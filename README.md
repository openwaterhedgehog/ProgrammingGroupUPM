## Description of the content (files and dirs.)

it is not necessary to describe the content of each subdirectory

## Running the project
The final project statement is divided in 3 parts: web scraping, data generation
and data analysis. Thus, a brief explanation of how to run your code for each
part (either explaining the instructions for the steps to follow or a Makefile or
equivalent file). Also indicate python packages and versions required by your
code.
## Modules
A list of the Python modules/files included in your project, briefly indicating a
description of them. There is no need to describe each file on a function basis,
simply a general description of the file. For example: file File1.py computes
the different asset allocations for portfolios.
What functionality required have been addressed in the code, relating (if possible) project requirements with the code implemented. For example, indicate: functionality about web scraping has been addressed in files File1.py,
File2.py
